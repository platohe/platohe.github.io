## Platohe's Github Landing Page

### Instructions

The github landing page is created based on a Minimal Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. See full step by step tutorial [on Medium](https://medium.com/@evanca/set-up-your-portfolio-website-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-github-pages-d0efa8ff56fd).
___

Use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for the website in Markdown files (index.md). Whenever commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the website, from the content in the Markdown files (for more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
